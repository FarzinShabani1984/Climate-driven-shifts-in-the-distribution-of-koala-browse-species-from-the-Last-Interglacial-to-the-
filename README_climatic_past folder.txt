This folder contains 5 sub-folders:

1)	cclgm
2)	ccmid
3)	lig
4)	mrlgm
5)	mrmid

•	cc is the abbreviation for the CCSM4 model
•	mr is the abbreviation for the MIROC-ESM model
•	lig is the abbreviation for the Last Interglacial (~128–116 ka) 
•	lgm is the abbreviation for the Last Glacial Maximum (~23–19 ka) 
•	mid is the abbreviation for the Mid-Holocene (~7–5 ka)

In each of the aforementioned folders, we provide six climatic variables as plausible predictors of species distribution: 
1) bi1 (annual mean temperature, in °C);
2) bi4 (temperature seasonality = standard deviation × 100); 
3) bi5 (maximum temperature of the warmest month, in °C);
4) bi12 (annual precipitation, in mm); 
5) bi14 (precipitation of the driest month, in mm); and 
6) bi19 (precipitation of the coldest quarter)

We used these climate variables to predict and project the distribution of the 60 koala-browse species at a coarse geographic scale to cover annual, seasonal, and absolute characteristics of climate that could dictate the growing conditions experienced by trees.

We built our model using WorldClim data (worldclim.org), and we are not redistributing the WorldClim data themselves. Refer to:
