This folder contains six climatic variables as plausible distribution predictors: 

1) bi1 (annual mean temperature, in °C);
2) bi4 (temperature seasonality = standard deviation × 100); 
3) bi5 (maximum temperature of the warmest month, in °C);
4) bi12 (annual precipitation, in mm); 
5) bi14 (precipitation of the driest month, in mm); and 
6) bi19 (precipitation of the coldest quarter).

We used these climate variables to predict and project the distribution of the species at a coarse geographic scale to cover annual, seasonal, and absolute characteristics of climate that could dictate the growing conditions experienced by trees.

We built our model using WorldClim data (worldclim.org), and we are not redistributing the WorldClim data themselves. Refer to:
